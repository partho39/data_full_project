## ðŸš€ About Me
Hello! I have a strong background in data analysis and a strong desire to transform data into insights and useful solutions. Having a solid foundation in statistical modeling, data analysis, and data visualization, I can take on challenging issues and provide insightful solutions that will propel business expansion.

I've worked in various businesses for a long time, including technology, healthcare, finance, and retail. Using R, Python, Seaborn, SQL, Shiny, PowerBi, and Tableau, among other tools, I can manage and analyze big data sets and effectively and persuasively communicate my findings.

Although I am a self-starter and like working alone, I am also a great team player and do my best in a collaborative setting. I'm always looking for new challenges and chances to further my abilities.

I would be a fantastic fit for you if you're searching for a data analyst who is committed, competent, and constantly willing to learn and advance.
